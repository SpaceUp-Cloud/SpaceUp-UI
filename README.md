# SpaceUp-UI

## Modern UI with Flutter for Web, Android, Windows and Linux.

For Linux you can find it here (right now as beta!)

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/spaceup-ui)

Installation for Linux:
```bash
sudo snap install spaceup-ui --channel=beta --devmode
```

### Requirements to build by your own
* Git
* Flutter (current version)
* Android SDK (if you want to build for Android)

... else you need of course the SpaceUp-Server and an Uberspace 7!

```bash
# platform: apk, web, windows and etc.
flutter build <platform>
# or optionally run directly
flutter run
```
